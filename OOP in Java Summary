Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts is crucial for any software developer, especially when working with Java. 

Here are the key OOP concepts you need to know:

1️⃣ Abstraction: Focus on essential features while hiding unnecessary details to simplify coding and enhance clarity.

2️⃣ Encapsulation: Bundle data and methods that operate on the data together, ensuring better control and security.

3️⃣ Inheritance: Create new classes that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes, promoting reusability.

4️⃣ Polymorphism: Use a single interface to represent different forms, allowing flexibility in code.

5️⃣ Association: Define relationships between classes, indicating how they are connected in some way.

6️⃣ Aggregation: Establish a "whole-part" relationship where one class contains others, showing a larger structure.

7️⃣ Composition: A stronger form of aggregation where one class is composed of other classes, ensuring a tighter relationship.

8️⃣ Coupling: Understand the dependency between classes, aiming to minimize it for better modularity.

9️⃣ Cohesion: Ensure each class focuses on a single purpose, making the code more readable and maintainable.
